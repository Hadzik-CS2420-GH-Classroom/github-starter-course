## :octocat: Git and GitHub

Git is a **distributed Version Control System (VCS)**, which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you’ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. It also makes working with others easier—groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!

GitHub is a way to use the same power of Git all online with an easy-to-use interface. It’s used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects.

GitHub is home to some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics of GitHub, but we'll dig into the rest later.

## :octocat: Understanding the GitHub flow 

The GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that helps you collaborate safely and deploy often. Below are the basic steps and a simple visual to make the process easier to follow.

### GitHub flow — beginner steps (no branch required)
If you are new to Git and GitHub and are working in your own repository (for example a classroom assignment or a fork), you can follow this simpler flow without creating branches.

1. Clone your repository
   - `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Make changes in the default branch (`main`)
   - Edit files locally using your editor.
3. Commit your changes locally
   - `git add .` then `git commit -m "Short, clear message"`
4. Push your changes to GitHub
   - `git push` (this uploads your `main` changes to your GitHub repo)
5. Submit or share your work
   - If your assignment requires a pull request, open a PR from your repository's `main` to the classroom/upstream repo. Otherwise, notify your instructor or share the repo link.
6. Review and update if needed
   - If feedback arrives, make updates locally, commit, and push — GitHub will show the new commits on the same PR or in your repo.

### Simple visual (text flow)

`local` -> `main` (edit) -> `push` -> `submit/PR` -> `review` -> `merge/feedback`

### Tips and checklist for beginners
- Work on `main` only if you own the repository (classroom repos or forks). Avoid editing `main` on shared team repos.
- Keep commits small and clear.
- Add a short description when submitting or opening a PR so reviewers know what changed.
- Run any tests or checks you can before pushing.
- When you feel comfortable, try the branch-based flow (recommended for team projects).

This simplified flow makes it easier to get started while still encouraging good commit and submission habits.

### Repositories

### What is a repository?
- A repository is your project folder on GitHub. It stores files, the full commit history, issues, pull requests, and other project metadata.

### Who uses repositories?
- You can work alone or invite collaborators. Classroom assignments and forks are common for students; teams usually use shared org repos.

### How to access a repository
- Use the GitHub website to browse files and history, or `git clone <repo-url>` to work locally. Your [GitHub dashboard](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/about-your-personal-dashboard) helps you find your repos.

### What belongs in a repository?
- Source code, documentation, tests, configuration, and a `README` that explains the project.

### README guidance (what to include)
- Short overview: What the project is and why it exists.
- Getting started: How to clone, install, and run the project (example commands).
- Usage: Brief examples or screenshots.
- Contributing (optional): How others can help or submit changes.
- License and contact info.

### Quick tips
- Choose a clear repository name.
- Keep the `README` up to date with basic setup steps.
- Add small examples or commands so others can run the project quickly.

To learn more about repositories and READMEs, read [Creating, Cloning, and Archiving Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories) and [About READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes).

### Cloning a Repository

- When a repository is created on GitHub, it is stored **online (remote)**.
- **Cloning** creates a **local copy** of that repository on your computer.
- The local copy stays linked to the GitHub version so changes can be synced.
- Cloning allows you to:
  - Edit files using tools like **Visual Studio** instead of the GitHub website.
  - Fix issues and add or remove files more easily.
  - Make and push **larger or multiple commits**.
- When you clone a repository, Git downloads:
  - All files and folders in the project.
  - The **entire version history** of the repository.
- Having the full history lets you:
  - Experiment safely.
  - Revert back to an older version if something breaks.
- read ["Cloning a Repository"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository). 

### Committing and Pushing

- **Committing** and **pushing** are how you move changes from your computer to GitHub.
- A **commit**:
  - Saves a snapshot of your changes.
  - Acts like a **checkpoint** you can return to later.
- Each commit should include a clear **commit message** that describes what you changed.
  - Example: `Added README with project information`
- **Pushing**:
  - Uploads your commits to the remote repository on GitHub.
  - Allows your instructor and teammates to see your work.
- You can make multiple commits as you work and push them when you are ready to share.

💡 *Tip:* Small, frequent commits with clear messages make it easier to track your progress and troubleshoot issues.

## 💻 GitHub terms to know 


### Repositories

- Repositories are where your project files and history live (code, issues, PRs, etc.).
- Use your [GitHub dashboard](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/about-your-personal-dashboard) to find and manage your repos.
- Add a `README` to explain what your project does, how to run it, and how others can contribute.
- Classroom students often work in their own repos or forks; teams use shared organization repos.
- Learn more: [Creating, Cloning, and Archiving Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories) • [About READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes)

### Branches

- What are branches?
  - Independent lines of development that let you work without changing the `main` branch.
- Why use branches?
  - Develop features, fix bugs, or experiment safely in isolation.
- Create a branch (local)
  - `git checkout -b my-branch` or `git switch -c my-branch`
- Share and merge
  - Push: `git push -u origin my-branch`
  - Open a pull request to merge into `main` after review.
- Tips
  - Use descriptive names (e.g. `feature/login`, `fix/typo`) and keep branches focused and short-lived.
- Learn more: [About Branches](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches).

### Forks

- What is a fork?
  - A fork is a personal copy of someone else's repository on your GitHub account.
- Why fork?
  - Experiment, fix bugs, or add features without changing the original project.
- Typical workflow
  - Click "Fork" on the upstream repository (GitHub website).
  - Clone your fork: `git clone <your-fork-url>`
  - Make changes, commit, and push to your fork.
  - Open a pull request from your fork to the original repository to propose changes.
- Tips
  - Keep your fork up to date with the upstream repo (`git remote add upstream <url>` then `git fetch upstream` / `git merge` or `git rebase`).
  - Use branches in your fork for each change to keep work organized.
- Learn more: [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)

### Pull requests

- What is a pull request (PR)?
  - A PR is a request to merge changes from one branch (or fork) into another and starts a discussion and review process on GitHub.
- Why use PRs?
  - Get feedback, run automated checks (CI), and review changes before they become part of `main`.
- How to open a PR
  - Push your branch or fork to GitHub, then click "Compare & pull request" (or open a new PR) and add a description and reviewers.
- Review and iterate
  - Reviewers can comment or request changes. Push follow-up commits to the same branch to address feedback.
- Merge and close
  - After approval and passing checks, merge the PR into the target branch and delete the feature branch if desired.
- Tips
  - Write a clear PR title and description, link related issues, and keep changes focused to make review easier.
- Learn more: [About Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

  [![What is a pull request? (short intro)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/nCKdihvneS0/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCKdihvneS0&list=PL0lo9MOBetEGWDtUgEsQoW0lgwytsZDvu&index=3)

### Issues
Issues are a way to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your work on GitHub. Issues are a great way to keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project and let others know what you plan to work on. You can also use issues to tell a favorite open source project about a bug you found or a feature you think would be great to add!

For larger projects, you can keep track of many issues on a project board. GitHub Projects help you organize and prioritize your work and you can read more about them [in this "About Project boards document](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards). You likely won’t need a project board for your assignments, but once you move on to even bigger projects, they’re a great way to organize your team’s work!
You can also link together pull requests and issues to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request.
To learn more about issues and linking them to your pull requests, read ["About Issues"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues). 

### Your user profile

Your profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you're interested in, the contributions you've made, and the conversations you've had. You can also give the world a unique view into who you are with your profile README. You can use your profile to let future employers know all about you! 
To learn more about your user profile and adding and updating your profile README, read ["Managing Your Profile README"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme). 

### Using markdown on GitHub 

You might have noticed already, but you can add some fun styling to your issues, pull requests, and files. ["Markdown"](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is an easy way to style your issues, pull requests, and files with some simple syntax. This can be helpful to organize your information and make it easier for others to read. You can also drop in gifs and images to help convey your point!
To learn more about using GitHub’s flavor of markdown, read ["Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). 

### Engaging with the GitHub community

The GitHub community is vast. There are many types of people who use GitHub in their day to day—students like you, professional developers, hobbyists working on open source projects, and explorers who are just jumping into the world of software development on their own. There are many ways you can interact with the larger GitHub community, but here are three places where you can start. 

#### Starring repositories 

If you find a repository interesting or you want to keep track of it, star it! When you star a repository it’s also used as a signal to surface better recommendations on github.com/explore. If you’d like to get back to your starred repositories you can do so via your user profile. 
To learn  more about starring repositories, read ["Saving Repositories with Stars"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/saving-repositories-with-stars). 

#### Following users 

You can follow people on GitHub to receive notifications about their activity and discover projects in their communities. When you follow a user, their public GitHub activity will show up on your dashboard so you can see all the cool things they are working on. 
To learn more about following users, read ["Following People"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/following-people).

#### Browsing GitHub Explore 

GitHub Explore is a great place to do just that … explore :smile: You can find new projects, events, and developers to interact with.

You can check out the GitHub Explore website [at github.com/explore](https://github.com/explore). The more you interact with GitHub the more tailored your Explore view will be.
